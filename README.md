gtksourceview-files
===================

My gtksourceview files. For gedit, etc.

## Using

Download any files you want to use. Add (or symlink to) them in your gtksourceview directory, which you might find in one of the following locations:

 - "~/.gnome2/gtksourceview-1.0/"
 - "~/.gnome2/gtksourceview-2.0/"
 - "~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/"
 - "~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/"
 - "/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/"
 - "/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/"

To see changes, you may need to restart your gtksourceview-dependent program (i.e. gedit).
